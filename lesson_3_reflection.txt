When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When i want to access my code from a remote computer / to add contributors form all around the world

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

i may working on a feature and don't want conflict with master


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork in github directly and pay credits to the creator / clone from github to my local environment / branches for new features
