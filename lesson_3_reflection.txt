When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When i want to access my code from a remote computer / to add contributors form all around the world

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

i may working on a feature and don't want conflict with master
