What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

You can either commit too many times or less than necessary.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Files may be related to each other (functions)

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log to get all commits history and git diff between two commits in order dive into more details

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can always get back to commits without bugs
